Recently i switched to Hugo and I thought Disqus would suit my needs, until I realized how fucked up is Disqus (thanks David!). Then I decided to change it to Commento.

* Installation

Easy: I used [[https://github.com/fidiego/commento-heroku][this]] and deployed to Heroku knowing by heart the URL i would be using for storing the website on it.
  
* Configuration

  Easy: You add the website you want to manage on the leftmost part after registering - remember to disable registration after creating your admin account(s).

* Now what?

  You tell me, enjoy :P

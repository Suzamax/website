* I hate Rust.

No, seriously, why are everybody so crazy about Rust, doing whatever with it?

It's a mess to get something compiled for i586. They are proudly saying that they're the most efficient programming language in the world and so, but you can't have it in a Pentium III...

* Solution?

So I had to cross-compile some Rust applications (yes, ncspot) from my main laptop to get it working on my ThinkPad...

And this madness is going further: Linux team are planning on integrating it. What happened with Torvalds?

* What should we expect?

Anyways, I'll stick with C. My two pennies on it that Rust integration in the Linux kernel would be a great fiasco.

Fuck Rust.

Also fuck Golang.

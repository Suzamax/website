* Who am I?
Sysadmin, aspiring to be DevOps, frontend & backend web developer.

I'm a curious person, always willing to learn something new, if I need to or just for fun.

I started using computers so long ago (Windows 3.1!). Fascinated by what did that machine, I decided to use them and understand how they work, what I can do with them... I met Linux, OS X, and more, and I didn't stop learning!
